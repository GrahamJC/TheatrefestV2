	<br>
	<h3>application procedure</h3>
	<p><b>applications are now closed</b></p>
	<ul class="indent"><li><p>The programming of the Regular Venues is decided by drawing the names of companies who have applied from a hat.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>on-line application form</b> was live between Monday 19th November and Friday 14th December.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The draw</b> will take place  on Saturday 15th December. Companies able to commit to three performances will be drawn first followed by companies unable to make that commitment. This will establish the order in which places will be offered.</p></li>
<li><p>10 slots are reserved for North Devon companies, 2 slots for International companies and the other 35 slots are available to companies from across the UK.  If there aren't sufficient North Devon or International companies to take up the reserved slots, these slots are then open to companies from across the UK.</p></li>
		
<li><p>One application per company - though companies can also apply for an Alt Space slot.</p></li>	
<li><p>The first 47 companies drawn from the hat will be offered a place and asked for initial confirmation so that the matching of companies to venues can begin.</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>waiting-list</b> will be established.</p></li>
<li><p>A firm commitment from companies will be required by Friday January 18th, by which time venues will have been allocated. The firm commitment will need to be sealed by the payment of the <b>&pound;100 		participation fee (&pound;65 of which is refundable so long as the agreed performances have been delivered)</b> and the provision of a marketing image, publicity copy and required technical information. If these aren't forthcoming by January 18th then the slot will be offered to the next company on the waiting-list that fits the requirements for the vacant slot.</p></li>
<li><p>Productions in Regular Venues must be <b>between 30 mins and 60 mins</b> in length. There will be a one-hour technical rehearsal programmed in. There will be only 15 minutes available to set-up and get-out before and after each performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ticket prices for 2019 will be &pound;6, &pound;4 concessions and a Frequent Fringer Voucher that works out at &pound;3 per ticket (6 tickets for &pound;18).  100% of ticket money is returned to the company.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Companies are responsible for their own Public Liability Insurance. We will need to see confirmation.</b> We will happily advise on cheap options - we are currently investigating a source of cheap PLI that looks very promising indeed!</p></li>
<li><p>Please be aware that we do our best to provide <b>free billets for out-of-town companies</b> in order to keep the cost of participating low.</p></li></ul>
<br><br>
<h3>the venues</h3>
<p>For 2019 we have <b>seven Regular Venues</b>.  The level of technical support in these venues varies so please read the descriptions below.</p> 
<ul class="indent">
<li><p>The <span class="FTF">Baptist Hall</span> has a flat-floor stage area 5m wide x 6m deep with raked seating for 60. It is configured as a black-box studio space. Basic warm and cold lighting states will be available along with some ability to separate areas.  There will be a sound system installed. There are sensitivities that have to be observed with regard to content - specifically alcohol and strong language are non-starters.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="FTF">Golden Lion Tap</span> has a stage area 5m wide x 4m deep with staggered seating for 60.  Basic warm and cold lighting states will be available along with a limited ability to separate areas. There will be a sound system installed.</p></li>
		
<li><p><span class="FTF">St Anne's Arts Centre</span> is a versatile space best played with audience on two sides or in the round. In that configuration the acting area is roughly 4m x 8m. End on is possible but sightlines are tricky. There is seating for 50.  Basic warm and cold lighting states will be available along with a limited ability to separate areas. There will be a sound system installed. </p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="FTF">Guildhall</span> has a large carpeted performance area - 7m x 7m - and raked seating for 80. It is an historic, civic building that used to be the magistrates' court and which is still used for the official business of the town council.  It will be blacked-out and equipped with a sound-system and lighting.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="FTF">The Southgate</span> is an intimate, well-focussed space above a bar-bistro.  The performance area is approximately 3m wide x 2m deep. It will have lights and sound and seating for 30.  Because the seating capacity is lower than elsewhere we offer companies four performances so that they can make up the potential audience numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="FTF">Castle Centre</span> has a low stage, 5m wide and 3.5m deep.  We install a lighting rig - from stands at the back of the auditorium - and a sound system. There is flat-floor seating for 60 with some higher chairs at the back to help sight-lines.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="FTF">Tent on The Strand</span> is 7.5m wide and 12m long.  The height of the sides is 2m, sloping up to an apex of 4m height. The stage area is 7m wide and 4m deep. There wil be seating for 60. This year we are moving the Tent from The Square (where there was significant traffic noise) to The Strand (where traffic noise is negligible).  However, we must be mindful that what happens in the Tent can be heard outside, so content must be suitable for a public arena. Lighting and sound will be installed but the impact of the lighting cover is restricted by natural light.</p></li></ul>
