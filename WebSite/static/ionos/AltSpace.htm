<h3 style="font-size: 2.3em">alt space information</h3>
<br>
<h3>application procedure</h3>
	<p><b>applications open 19th November and close 22nd March</b></p>

<ul class="indent"><li><p>Companies are <b>welcome to arrange their own venue</b> if they so wish. This could be a building, a tent, a vehicle or any other controlled space to which an audience might be admitted, or a public space such as a park or a street.</p></li>
<li><p>The performing company will be responsible for any costs and permissions associated with the venue but Fringe TheatreFest will be happy to offer advice. <b>We already have blanket permission for use of most outside areas in the town</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Alt Space performances can be of any length. Companies are welcome to perform as many (or as few) times as they wish, so long as we have the capacity to steward the events adequately. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Alt Space performances operate on a pay-as-you-will basis.</b>  We provide a steward with a collecting-bucket and companies keep 100% of monies collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Alt Space slots are allocated on a <b>first-come-first-served</b> basis - so early application is advisable. There will be 32 slots available. Applications will be made through an <b>on-line application form</b>. If the 32 slots are already claimed before 22 March, companies will be put on a waiting-list in the order in which they applied in case a slot becomes available.</p></li> 
<li><p>Companies working in Alt Space venues will pay a <b>&pound;100 participation fee which will be fully refunded so long as the company fulfils its performance commitments</b>. We won't collect the participation fee - and therefore participation won't be confirmed - until we're clear that the activity can go ahead in the chosen location.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Companies are responsible for their own Public Liability Insurance. We will need to see confirmation.</b> We will happily advise on cheap options - we are currently investigating a source of cheap PLI that looks very promising indeed!</p></li>
<li><p>Please be aware that we do our best to provide <b>free billets for out-of-town companies</b> in order to keep the cost of participating low.</p></li></ul>
<br><br>
<h3>particular opportunities</h3>

	<p>There are buildings and businesses that <span class="FTF">Fringe TheatreFest</span> has a relationship with and sites that have proved popular in the past.</p>
	<ul class="indent"><li><p><span class="FTF">Barnstaple Library</span> has hosted performances in previous years both in the children's area and in the main body of the Library.</p></li>
		<li><p><span class="FTF">Green Lanes Shopping Centre</span> hosted performances in several sites throughout the centre last year, including their central display area, the top of their car park and in a vacant shop window.</p></li>
		<li><p><span class="FTF">White Moose Gallery</span> has hosted events over the past couple of years.  There's room for up to 30 depending on how much space the presentation takes up.  It is a working gallery so nothing too wild that might jeopardise the exhibits and it's a big plus if the exhibition and the production complement each other!</p></li>
		<li><p><span class="FTF">Boston Tea Party</span> hosted a children's show upstairs in their coffee shop last year which worked well for all. </p></li>
		<li><p><span class="FTF">Escape Down the Rabbit Hole</span> hosted two spoken-word productions last year.  They have since expanded their outside presence.</p></li>
	
		<li><p>The <span class="FTF">High Street</span> was a great outside venue for classic street entertainment - and the crowds were generous.</p></li>
		<li><p><span class="FTF">Castle Green</span> and <span class="FTF">Castle Mound</span> have both worked successfully as venues for dramas.  The Green has acres of room; the Mound is picturesque and atmospheric with a limit of about 40 punters.  It's a moderately steep climb to the top of the Mound.</p></li></ul>
