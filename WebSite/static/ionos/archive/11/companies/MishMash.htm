<h1>Spectacular Vernacular... in 3D!</h1>

<p>We have something deeply important to tell you, our distilled thoughts seeking to recapture the essence of a moment, a memory, a feeling big or small. It's vibrant, passionate, powerful and engaging. It's about emotion, truth, rhythm and expression. Challenging the boundaries between poetry, rap, song and performance it's the return of ...Spectacular Vernacular ...in 3D!</p>
<p>Last year independent Fringe Reviewer Sheila Wilson said <em>"a plethora of potent poetry. The poems are emotional, improvised, funny and sensuous, but most of all they are exciting and new. The production is well rehearsed and fluently delivered. Even if poetry isn't your 'thing' give this a try, you could well be converted."</em></p>
<p>2009 Reviewer Vicky Webb said <em>"Come and experience something beautiful at the fringe this weekend!.....a truly evocative piece that is only made possible by the exuberant passion and understanding that this cast holds for their subjects...I would encourage everyone to come along to Spectacular Vernacular for a fresh and exciting experience where the power of poetry is brought to life."</em></p>
<p><b>Spectacular Vernacular</b> explores ways of presenting words and pairs them with performance ideas to express themes in life we can all identify with. This year our writers seem preoccupied with time: the changes it brings to us, our environment, and our relationships, how we can be inside or outside of a moment, our ability to reminisce, and time's inescapable nature. Please make time to see us! We promise to continue to be as diverse as possible in mood, style, and method, and attempt to offer something for all tastes which will enrich your day.
