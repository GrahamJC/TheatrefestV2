<h1>The End of the World is Nigh</h1>
<h2>Bob Harding-Jones<br />

<p>Is Man fast-tracking to Armageddon?&nbsp; This show traces his progress to date.&nbsp; How do you think he&rsquo;s doing?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an enjoyable romp of music, poetry and  prose &ndash; with no recycled rubbish.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Bob (poetry and prose) is joined by Brian Heywood (guitar/vox) for the Thursday performance.</p><br />

<p><b>listen to a <a href="http://www.thinkingaboutourworld.co.uk/taow-rf.wav" target="_blank"><u>musical preview</u></a></b></p>

<p><b>Bob Harding-Jones</b></p>
 
<p><b>Writer - Performer – Poet</b></p>
 

<p>Bob developed his skill at humorous writing and performing whilst a teenager, reading his hilarious accounts of everyday events to a delighted school assembly. A career in suburban accountancy was abandoned for the love of the country. Agricultural college, then supervisory livestock positions preceded the tenancy of a Hertfordshire dairy farm. Then another career change: qualifying as an ambulance paramedic on his 50th birthday (OK, so I’m a late starter).</p>
<p>Bob now combines a career as a paramedic with writing and performing. Bob initially submitted sketches to television and magazines - including the BBC’s satirical radio show WeekEnding - and joined a group of writers he met there to contribute to the scripting of Newsrevue: a weekly satirical revue on London’s ‘Fringe’.</p>
<p>Bob initially performed poetry on the Comedy Circuit - including The Comedy Store - but now performs his style of poetry and humour at festivals, schools, clubs and village halls. Bob has performed successful one-man shows and conducted children’s poetry workshops at Edinburgh Festival Fringes, performed at the Glastonbury Festival 2007, and his one-man show: Laughter in the Village is a countrywide regular. Bob also writes light-hearted newspaper and magazine articles and is the new humour columnist for the <a href="http://www.maturetimes.co.uk/Mature-Times-humour-comment" target="_blank">Mature Times</a>.</p>
<p>The End of The World is Nigh is a new venture with a long, long life – but you never know do you!</p>

<p><b>Brian Heywood</b>
<img src="../../11/companies/BobHJ2.jpg" alt="" class="rightpic" /></p>
 
<p>A guitarist, vocalist, band leader, arranger, composer, producer and
award winning song writer - Brian has a formidable array of skills and
experience. He is just as at home on a big festival stage in outback
Western Australia as an indie live music club in the heart of London.</p>

<p>Specialising in edgy roots fusion music, previous work has received
comments such as "... aggressive, top notch fiddling set off by periodic
guitar explosions." - Tom Nelligan, Dirty Linen Magazine (USA), "Just
when it seemed as if newer electric British roots bands were getting
thinner on the ground - Very welcome and very good." - fROOTS Magazine
(UK) and Steve Barnes Fairbridge Festival Artistic Director (Australia) -
"... a rocking band - I was delighted with the audience response."</p>

<p>Brian is an Australian musician who relocated to the UK in the early 80's.
As well as live performance, he also composes for live and video/film
soundtracks, produce and engineer for recordings in a variety of styles.
