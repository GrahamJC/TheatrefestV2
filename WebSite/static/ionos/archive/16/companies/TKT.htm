<p>Peter Lanyon was a landscape painter born and bred in St.Ives Cornwall. In 1964, having found a new passion and a fresh perspective on landscape through gliding, he came into land at an airfield near Taunton and had an accident.</p>

<p>According to his son Mathew After three days in hospital, recovering from a minor injury to his back, he had ‘just about exhausted the possibilities of the hospital ceiling.’ He was bored and ready to go home to his wife and family when a blood clot formed on a cut on his leg, travelled to his brain and killed him at the age of 46.</p>

<br />	
<p>A celebration of Lanyon’s lust for life, his mischievous sense of humour and rebelliousness this performance dramatises the moment of his untimely death and stretches it into 45 minutes of dynamic, slightly absurd, imaginative, physical theatre balanced precariously between reality and fantasy, life and death, a cliff edge and a hospital bed. Broken Air successfully debuted as a work in progress at the Stroud Theatre Festival in September and has since been performed in Lithuania before coming to the UK in June.</p>

<p>Paul Attmere trained in mime and physical theatre and has worked as a performer with various companies in the UK and Europe. He now lives and works between the UK and Lithuania. Broken Air is his first solo theatre performance.</p>
