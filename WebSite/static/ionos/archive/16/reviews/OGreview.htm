<h1>Banging Fun Stuff</h1>
<h2>Oh Glow</h2><br />
<p>Banging Fun Stuff does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s fringe theatre at its best. Quirky, original, bonkers!</p><p>

The piece is based around a crime scene that our “heroine”, the middle aged Irish PC Pauline has to solve. I must confess, it took me a while to warm to her and the performance in general. It wasn’t until the audience got involved that things started to pick up for me. I too was chosen to take part in the action and, without giving away too much, I came away knowing PC Pauline a whole lot more than I had ever anticipated!</p><p>

The use of music and sound effects were used brilliantly. The poor, put upon assistant to Pauline was certainly made to work hard and she let him know if things weren’t right. You could see he was having a ball though!</p><p>

As things progress, you find yourself falling utterly in love with PC Pauline. She’s barking mad and has a strange obsession with her musical spoons and even if we couldn’t quite work out what she was playing, the fun was in discovering what it was, which caused much hilarity, as did her fabulous dance moves. Her energy was excellent.</p><p>

Catch this performance while you’ve got the chance. Who knows? You may get up close and personal with a copper and get away it!<br />
