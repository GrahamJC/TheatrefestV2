<h1>Granny Smith</h1>
<h2>Theatre Transformations</h2><br />
<p>“Bonjour!” The show hasn't even started yet but already we are being greeted and instantly we warm to the friendly, French-speaking star of the show.</p><p>

Many may be intimidated by the concept of an interactive performance, but there's certainly no need to be afraid of Granny Smith. She is kind, friendly and funny, so it is easy to warm to her. Interactions are frequent and fun, ranging from learning French to helping Granny with cooking, and I would certainly recommend joining in.</p><p>

Time constraints unfortunately meant that the show felt a little rushed towards the end; I fear that I might have missed out on other interesting antics from Granny. But even so it was certainly packed full of fun.</p><p>

Throughout the show, Granny Smith was consistently funny and it was clear that the audience enjoyed themselves, both adults and children. Her facial expressions and gestures were cleverly portrayed to have the whole audience laughing.</p><p>

Overall, I would say this is a unique mix of French, cooking and even ‘gymnastics’, all with a fun and humorous feel.<br />
