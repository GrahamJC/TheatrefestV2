<h1>Dog Show</h1>
<h2>Sylvia Hunt Presents</h2><br />
<p>Dog Show is a one woman comedy show with puppets. If you love dogs this show is for you; if you don’t love dogs this show is a hilarious look at life from the dog lovers point of view and a from the perspective of various dogs. If you want to leave the theatre with your face aching from laughing this is definitely a must see.  </p><p>
Sylvia Hunt is a barking mad dog lady. The show is told through 10 short pieces of theatre which include aspects of physical theatre and puppetry. Each short features and aspect of canine behaviour we are all familiar with, sometimes endearing, sometimes sad, sometimes rather naughty.  </p><p>
The set features a traditional booth fit up stage which becomes a multiuse performance space. Puppets and stage are constructed by Mark Parrett who is also on the sound and lights. There are some very cleverly made puppets to look out for, especially the stunning poodle who children will adore. </p><p> 
Sylvia is a mesmerising performer who charms the audience with her energetic and quirky stage presence. She suffers terribly at the paws of some of her dog friends. She has great lip synch skills and comic timing and is both a good performer and puppeteer.
</p><p> 
This show would be fine for the younger audience as well as for the adults who were in fits of laughter throughout. There is a lot of audience participation so do come prepared to put on your best waggy tail and join in the fun.<br />
