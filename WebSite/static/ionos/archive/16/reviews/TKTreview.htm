<h1>Broken Air</h1>
<h2>Third Knock Theatre</h2><br />
<p>Physical Theatre based on a
true story of Cornish artist
Peter Lanyon who died in
1964 at the age of 46 years.
His hobby as a glider pilot
was inspirational to his art
work.</p><p>
Singular solo scenario
depicting the final days and untimely and sudden
death of the landscape artist following an accident in
his glider which was not thought to be life threatening
at the time.</p><p>
A proficient, polished performance from
accomplished artiste Paul Attmere, incorporating
dance, mime and subtle audience participation. The
evocative soundtrack transported us to Cornwall and
the paucity of props were used to maximum affect
to illustrate the scenery and environment of the
Cornish cliffs, in stark contrast to the austerity of the
hospital bed where John Lanyon spent his final three
days. The artistic agility was breath-taking, the
symbolism, thought provoking.</p><p>
Paul’s somewhat obsessive pre-occupation with this
relatively obscure true story went over my head -
rather like the glider and sea birds so brilliantly
portrayed in his passionate rendition.</p><p>
From his home in Lithuania, Paul’s contribution to our
10th anniversary of Theatrefest was immaculate in
execution, perfect in performance and educationally
excellent. I urge you to take advantage of this
opportunity to broaden your horizons.</p><p>
A real gem.<br />
