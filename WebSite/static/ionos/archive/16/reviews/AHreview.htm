<h1>When We Grow Up We'll Be Old</h1>
<h2>Almost Human</h2><br />
<p>Hands up, I didn’t understand this and it didn’t seem to be my cup of tea.  However, it was very interesting for many reasons.  Before I went, all I knew about it was that it is a “fantasy adventure and docu-fiction told through live film-making”.  This performance was the world première.</p><p>  
It showed us a great deal of the mechanics behind making a film: a scaled-down model set, numerous short, dislocated scenes, a green backcloth and superimposition over different scenes, some – if not all – local.  There were fun props, scripts and live voice-overs, sound effects and music, improvisation and audience participation.</p><p> 
Almost Human comprises three actors, who have rehearsed and improvised with young local actors.  The youngest of them has real style and throws himself into the whole thing.</p><p>  
We had three monitors, around which people tended to congregate.  I found my preferred spot, near their car, because the sound reproduction was clearer just there. Throughout, the audience was being photographed, or at least, cameras were being pointed at us, as if another documentary were being made.  Was this to show that we are in the middle of making our own documentaries of our lives, whilst the actors are documenting their own lives whilst making up stories? ... a story within stories within stories within stories!</p><p>  
There are many strands and I believe these may pull together more over the next few performances.  It’s a promenade performance in the Pannier Market, a great location and the whole set-up looks impressive in there.<br />
