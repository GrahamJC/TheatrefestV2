<h1>Spaghetti</h1>
<h2>Croon Productions<br /></h2><br />
<p>Spaghetti is a comedy puppet show in the style of the spaghetti western. There are 2 performers, 2 upright pianos, and a range of puppets including marionettes. </p><p>
If you think puppets are only for kids, think “Team America” and you will be closer to this fantastic piece of highly imaginative visual theatre. All the puppets are beautifully crafted by performer Pod Farlow, who is also responsible for the amazing piano world his characters inhabit. The second puppeteer Emily Lequesne had the audience in stitches with her facial expressions of bemused, clumsy uncertainty.   </p><p>
In some puppet shows there is a distance between the performer and the puppet but in this show the puppeteers have made the whole show flow through stylised movement where they interact with each scene as participants of the action. </p><p> 
There are no spoken words; the action follows a brilliant sound track of atmospheric Spanish guitar, frequent gunshots and music from way out west. This makes the show suitable for a wide audience, but not the under 12 age group. The reason being that like all great spaghetti westerns there is death, violence and more death. In fact the poor puppets are dispatched with regularity and in volume. The coffins were overflowing and the gallows swing low. </p><p>
Croon Productions are definitely my tip for the Fringe. The show is a perfect length and never falters in atmosphere and great performances. The two puppeteers have a great stage presence, they delighted the audience and they manipulate the puppets with skill.<br />
