<h1>The jewel you lost was blue</h1>
<h2>Sapta Dance Company</h2><br />
<p>When nine over 60’s came
together and responded to a
single line of the poem “Red”
by Ted Hughes, a beautiful
interpretation was formed.</p><p>
 Sapta Dance’s beautifully
choreographed piece was
carefully constructed
through a combination of
lighting, dance and sound. This cocktail of techniques
allowed the creation of an emotive sequence of
events, which fully engaged the audience in their
story.</p><p>
The absence of speech was barely noticed due to the
variation in intensity, pace and genre of the music
which allowed for the emotions of those on stage to
be effectively communicated to the audience.
Alongside this, the fluidity and complexity of their
movements clearly demonstrated their passion and
drive to perform, meaning that the audience
connected to both the actors on stage and to the story
that they were portraying.</p><p>
The audience gained perspective when watching this
performance due to the clever interaction between
the actors, costume and props. Copious amounts of
symbolism were present on stage, particularly within
the use of every-day items, such as books, kettles,
shoes and lipstick.</p><p>
I recommend watching this performance as it
stunningly captures the importance of individuality
and staying true to yourself, something which
everyone should be reminded of.<br />
