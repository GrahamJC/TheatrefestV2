<h1>Graveside Manner</h1>
<h2>Bill Jones</h2><br />
<p>I’ll be honest.
Graveside Manner
is not going to be
everybody’s cup
of tea. And why
should it be?</p><p>
The whole performance centres around an
incredibly miserable man lamenting his woeful
life and reading dark poetry. And do you know
what? I thought it was hilarious!
There was a real sense of schadenfreude from the
audience who were creased up in laughter as we
listened to Miserable Malcolm regale us with the
breakdown of his relationship with Mavis and her
new gym instructor boyfriend, Dave. Who’d have
thought so many words rhymed with Dave?</p><p>
Each morbid and dark word was spoken with such
gloom and doom that it really was hard to tell if
we were watching a performance or attending a
counselling session for this poor man. I think he
wanted us to feel sorry for him….I didn’t. Or
perhaps that was his intention as no matter how
depressing Malcom’s poems became, the
audience were laughing more and more.
A highlight for me was the “Melancholics
Anonymous” section which left me sore with
laughter.</p><p>
Graveside Manner is certainly like Marmite. You’ll
either love it or hate it. And that’s exactly what
great and inspiring theatre should do…..divide
opinion.</p><p>
This reviewer LOVED it!<br />
