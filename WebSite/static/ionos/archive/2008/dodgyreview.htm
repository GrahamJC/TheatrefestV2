    <h1>Dodgy Keeper</h1>
<p>You  don&rsquo;t have to like football to love the tale of the Dodgy Keeper.</p>
<p> He has a wife  whom he can&rsquo;t believe is having an affair with the team&rsquo;s striker, he has a  teenage daughter who knows about it, and he has a fancy for his sister in law.  I desperately wanted to know if he could save not only his team but also his  job, his marriage and his reputation, all of which are disintegrating around  him. </p>
<p>The trouble is he&rsquo;s a bloke who&rsquo;s not sure about women, and not even very  sure about people in general. He&rsquo;s the kind of bloke who&rsquo;s still playing in  goal long after he should have hung up his boots. But if you have any interest  in football at all this one-man show is a terrific kaleidoscopic experience. </p>
<p>Harry  Mottram knows all about the beautiful game as its played by the unbeautiful,  that is most of British men. Most of all he&rsquo;s studied dodgy keepers the world  over and discovered some intriguing truths about them and about men. </p>
<p>This was  an outstanding performance, full of energy and engagement, poetry and pathos. I  laughed at, but was also gripped by his re-enactment of the marital rows and of  his philosophy&nbsp; - &ldquo; I will  change&hellip;.tomorrow&rdquo; -&nbsp; &nbsp;centred on a fateful Saturday afternoon when  it seemed that his whole life rested on his performance between the sticks, the  match result and a bet on a horse. </p>
<p>Dodgy Keeper has the pace, the chants, the  characters and the drama. Go and see what happens.</p>
