<h1>Purple is for Sarcasm</h1>
<div id="showrubric">

<a href="Purple.htm"><img src="PurplePoster.jpg" alt="White Hipopos poster" class="leftpic" /></a>
<p>When I was young, I viewed the News as being an unnecessary half an hour when the TV went from being an endless source of entertainment, to being unspeakably boring. Even children’s programming during the week was interrupted by a slightly less boring version of the News fronted by John Craven clad in a variety of garish woolly jumpers, although it was certainly less boring than the News, it still felt like an absolute eternity when I was eagerly awaiting the next episode of Thundercats. </p>
<p>Obviously as I grew up, the boring half an hour, became the slightly-less-boring half an hour, then the actually-rather-interesting half an hour and finally the really interesting hour, after discovering Channel and Radio 4 News.</p>
<p>It is with genuine sadness that the News has once again become an absolutely unbearable half an hour. Twenty-four hour running News has gone from being the very best in investigative journalism to an endless repetitive stream of un-interesting, mostly ill-informed, barely researched conjecture and gossip. Most of the time the only reason for the Breaking News Story being broke as far as I can see is that it is happening now, not because it’s interesting, but because it’s current.</p>
<p>As I write this a popular Newspaper’s website is running a system whereby the top news stories are chosen and kept on their website by how many people are reading them, as a result the recent events in Zimbabwe are currently lagging behind a story about a celebrity falling out of a taxi cab.</p>
<p>We are now experiencing an age where News Stories are balanced against viewing figures, where gossip is touted as current affairs, where every story must come live from the scene even if nothing is happening at the scene and where Purple is for Sarcasm.</p>
<p>White Hippos Productions throw aside subtext and wear their hearts on their sleeves, as the try to discover what must run through the minds of the people who broadcast this nonsense…sorry “News”.</p>
