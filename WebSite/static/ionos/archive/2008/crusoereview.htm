    <h1>Robinson Crusoe - All Washed Up</h1>
    <p>
Ordinarily, if you heard that somebody does a one-man show about Robinson Crusoe while playing the accordion, you’d think, “Well, that’s weird.”</p>
<p>But this week you just think, “Well, that’s the Fringe.”</p>
<p>And so it is with Robinson Crusoe – All Washed Up, the solo show by Fergus Rougier of Berlin. If you’re looking for a straightforward telling of the classic story, this isn’t it. But if you’re looking for a guy who can sing a song (to the accordion) about not wanted to be eaten by cannibals, can bring in references to Queen and SpongeBob and can do marvelous things with a large blue sheet, this is your man.</p>
<p>Rougier doesn’t look like your idea of Crusoe: He’s dressed as a gymnast, or a particularly natty mime, and I’m not sure if his show is aimed at with-it adults or kids. But there’s something compelling about a performance that’s just so danged different. Every Fringe needs some of these. </p>

<p>A man emerges from under an enormous blue blanket into a howling
void to tell a tale of isolation, self-reliance, and the anthropological
ethics of cannibalism. Yeah, we are definitely at the Fringe.</p>
<p>Fergus Rougier’s one-man musicalization of Daniel Defoe’s classic
adventure story (don’t worry if you’ve never read the book, neither has
he) is the kind of show that could never survive in a commercial venue
– and thank god for that. For the first 5 minutes I was transfixed by
Rougier’s spindly legs, squeezed into improbable striped knee pants.
For the next 5, I was fascinated by his gangling, contorted physicality;
he embodies a unique movement quality somewhere between
pantomime and modern dance, settling on a mixture of a Cirque du
Soleil strongman and Ed Grimley. And all that was even before he
started playing “We Are the Champions” and “What Do You Do With a
Drunken Sailor” on his accordion.</p>
<p>As the initial disorientation abated (it never completely disappeared) a
kind of stage-bound Stockholm Syndrome set in, rendering me
incapable of evaluating the show by any rational gauge. Are Roguier’s
perplexing persona and yowling vocalizations serious or slyly
sarcastic? Are the pop-culture references to Castaway and Hannibal
Lecter indicative of po-mo self-awareness or media-addled mania?
Are avant-garde appreciating adults his target audience, or
developmentally-delayed adolescents? Is this the worst Fringe show
I’ve seen this year, or the best? I have no fucking clue. I just know
that, while often bizarre and befuddling, Rougier’s show is never banal
or boring. If you’re prepared for the most unconventional hour you’ll
find at Fringe, go see Robinson Crusoe and decide for yourself just
what the hell it is.</p>

 <p>Finally on Sunday I caught Fergus Rougier perform his one  man show <strong>Robinson Crusoe: All Washed Up</strong>. His material, based on the story of Robinson Crusoe,  could not fit a one man show more sweetly as we watched the performer marooned on  his lonely stage trying to survive, trying to reach the end of the tale. The  storyteller, even when narrating or singing about Crusoe and his situation,  always was Crusoe and this allowed Rougier to both comment on Crusoe&rsquo;s  character and his in built racism without ever losing sight of the man in his  desperate plight - until at last he can jump stage amidst great applause and sail  home. Fergus Rougier is a multi-talented performer - a mime, an actor-storyteller, musician  and comic. This was indeed a virtuoso performance which, while constantly  poking fun at its own conceits, managed to express something moving about what  it is to be human - in other words, alone. </p>
