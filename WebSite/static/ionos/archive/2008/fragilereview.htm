    <h1>The Sparkling Fragile</h1>
<p>This was a well scripted play that reminded me very much of a Phillip K Dick novel. having not read anything about it beforehand I had no idea what to expect and as a sci fi addict I was pleasantly surprised when they started throwing ideas of time travel and alternate dimensions into the mix. <br />
  <br />
  The actors seemed to be really enjoying themselves and made full use of the stage and at times looked like they were going to fall off it which kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved the way there were all sorts of surprises thrown in and the part where they started talking gibberish was just brilliant. <br />
  <br />
  The only fault I can think of was that it took me a little while to realise when they were going into a flashback, I think this could have been helped by the addition of a hat or some kind of prop to help distinguish between Faith's character as fragile and as Richard's dead sister.<br />
  <br />
  To be able to convey such a complex story with nothing but a desk, a whiteboard and a PC was great, I look forward to seeing more plays by White Hippo Productions.</p>

<p>It brought tears to my eyes. Magic and real which if you think about it is an amazing   achievement. (Unless magic is real, I think some is. I think you proved that!)</p>
