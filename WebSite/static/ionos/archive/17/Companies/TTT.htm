	<p><b>Nature Knows Best</b> is a compilation of three short comedy plays by Devonshire playwright Nick Discombe. Each play portrays a day in the life of three different animal couplings.</p>
	<p><img src="TTT3.jpg" class="TTT" alt="sheep grazing" /></p>
	<br>
		<p><b>Sheep Mount</b> is a hilarious, yet poignant piece, in which a ewe and a ram escape their depressing lives on an enclosed farm in Devon, to roam free on Dartmoor. The defiant ewe, Zoe, is fed up of the farmer taking her young and hopes to rescue her relationship with her ram, Wayne, despite his roving eye. Meanwhile Wayne has been contending with many horrible scientific treatments from the farmer.</p>

		<p><b>Sea Gull Heaven</b> gives us a look into the life of two gulls that have been living out their days at a tip, where there are easy pickings for food because of mans wasteful habits. But due to city dangers and a wasteful life, they wish to get back to nature, so fly to the coast of Dawlish where they aim to cleanse their spirits.</p>

		<p><b>Seahorse Ride</b> changes our perceptions, as we see conventional roles within a relationship switch. The male of the species carries the children and gives birth to them and he is not at all happy about it. Not just for the obvious reason, but also because of mans effects on the environment that are deteriorating any chance of his births being successful.</p>

		<p><b>TicTac Theatre</b> (which stands for two is company three’s a crowd theatre) is an emerging theatre company based in Exeter that specialises in two-handers and multi role productions. TicTac’s repertoire includes a mixture of classical and contemporary plays. TicTac Theatre founded by Hannah Brooks and Scott Goodair in 2015 has been going from strength to strength.</p>

	<p>Hannah and Scott both trained at Cygnet Theatre where the emphasis is on character driven story telling. Working continuously with industry professionals whilst training and performing constantly in the repertory style, gave them both the opportunity to develop an ensemble approach to performing as well as giving them the technical and backstage skills to proceed in the industry.</p>

	<p>After graduating and having undertaken various professional roles with other companies, they wanted to create their own high calibre of work in the South West. Fortunate enough to have a strong working relationship with Jacquie Crago (Voice Coach for National Theatre Productions of Warhorse and One Man Two Guvnors as well as the RSC) she directed them in TicTac’s first two productions. TicTac Theatre also has a reputable patron in Actor & Director Peter Ellis (The Bill, Acorn Antiques, Seasons at RSC and Old Vic, What Would Helen Mirren Do?) and whom Hannah and Scott have also collaborated with.</p>

	<p>TicTac Theatre uses Cygnets ethos in its approach to each highly physical production. Using minimalistic set, Hannah & Scott draw attention to the text and action of the play. </p>

	<br>
<br>
		<p><b>TicTac Theatre's previous productions</b> were “The Open Couple” by Dario Fo and “You Were After Poetry”.</p>

	<p>“The Open Couple” premiered at the Bike Shed Theatre as part of the ‘From Devon With Love’ festival. Following on, were performances at a variety of theatres and festivals including the Harrogate theatre, The Queens Theatre Barnstaple, Alma Tavern Bristol, Stroud festival and Cygnet Theatre. “You Were After Poetry” took them to the same venues and in addition, The Everyman Theatre Cheltenham. Hannah & Scott are now hoping to build on the success of their last two tours by taking “Nature Knows Best” to Festivals around the UK, continuing to expand TicTac Theatres strong reputation for producing quality performances.</p>

		<p><em>“TicTac are a two-handed company founded by Hannah Brooks and Scott Goodair – and if you searched all year you couldn’t cast The Open Couple better.”</em></p>

		<p><em>“Brooks and Goodair attacked this demanding play with verve”</em></p>

		<p><em>“Brilliantly performed by TicTac Theatre”</em></p>
