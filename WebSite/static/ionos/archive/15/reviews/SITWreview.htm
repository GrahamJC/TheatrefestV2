<h1>Norse Tales</h1>
<h2>Spaniel In The Works Theatre Company</h2><br />
<p>Norse Tales is a fun family look at the mythologies, which incorporates dance, song and comedy to present the extraordinary tales of the Gods and their enemies. We started at Ginnungagap (the creation of the world) and then proceeded to sing and dance our way through the stories of gods and mythical beasts to the epic battle at Ragnarok. The duo from Spaniel in the Works Theatre company have really had their work cut out for them, to say they multi rolled is a bit of an understatement. Through the use of puppetry, props and costume they managed to create a variety of larger than life characters; from Loki with his flat cap to Odin and his troublesome eyepatch.</p>

<p>Structurally the performance is well laid out with clear introductions of the world and the characters it possesses making an easy and coherent narrative; this makes for a show perfectly catered to a younger audiences where tackling the complex myths could be challenging in a different format. The storytelling itself was a diverse mix of puppetry, narration and rhyme. Loki’s clever rhymes when describing the birth of his children were especially well crafted keeping the performance fluid. Spaniel in the Works also create an jovial party atmosphere with their rendition of ‘Viva Las Vegas’ and ‘Fire Starter’ as well as arming the audience with glow sticks. Overall they have created a charming retelling of the events surrounding the Norse gods and their enemies.<br /><em>Clarice Baker, The Daily Fringe</em>
