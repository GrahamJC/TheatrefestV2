<h1>The Elephant Dress</h1>
<h2>Antler & Feather</h2><br />
<p>The elephant dress is the debut performance from Antler and Feather and is inspired by real life experiences of living with an eating disorder. This is a young company who I really thought showed great potential. The characterisation delivered by each of the three actors was incredibly strong. I believed in their performances and was engaged throughout.</p>

<p>There are some parts of this play that cover commonly understood aspects of anorexia, but what I liked is that the audience were given more. I did not expect to be made to smile, or laugh even, but I was. I felt it was a very real performance, both in its writing and in the and in its delivery. Clearly a lot of research has been done and what you see on the stage is not the devastating stereotype, nor does it trivialise the condition. I think what it does really well is capture the every day experience of an eating disorder.</p>

<p>The purpose of this performance was in part to promote awareness and address the stigma attached to eating disorders and mental illness. I personally think it does this very well, because it did capture the ‘real’. The script and staging challenged me to think about the subject in a different way. It was interesting to see Ana, or anorexia, as a person and have her exist as a very real presence on the stage. It genuinely made me reconsider what my assumptions are about eating disorders and how they affect the sufferer and their relationships with others. A very thought-provoking, poignant performance which deserves to be seen.<br />
