<p>In <b>Cheap Bedsits</b> by Joe Stoneman, unscrupulous but likeable landlord Mr Chan owns a house converted into bedsits. He lets the rooms cheaply to any tenants who are willing to fake a disability in return for the reduced rent!</p>

<p>Mr Chan receives subsidies from the local council for each bedsit that he rents to a ‘disabled’ person. He is also in cahoots with one of his tenants, Alan, who supplies him with the stolen identifications of real disabled people, which Alan obtains from the files of his employers!</p>

<p>However, for Chan to receive the subsidies, the council carry out occasional inspections of the house and its tenants, in order to make sure said ‘disabled’ people are occupying the rooms. When such a visit is due, Chan briefs his co-conspiring tenants to make sure they are all rehearsed in the art of faking their own designated disability! As the pressure mounts on Chan to deceive the visiting inspector, panic and confusion ensues as Chan’s devious deception goes hilariously awry!
