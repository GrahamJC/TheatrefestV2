    <h1>Assorted Accumulation/Floor Plan</h1>         
<p>An experimental piece by a group of Dartington College students Floor Plan explores ideas of individuality and community. The seven performers include an on-stage director and sound artist giving an impression that the structure allows for improvisation and development based on the actions of each member and their interpretation of the performance space.</p>

<p>Through stylised and controlled movement familiar physical expressions become robot like, suggesting the erosion of individuality in a controlled setting; the lone voice is rarely heard above the choking necessity of production. The success of Floor Plan lies in the sense of atmosphere that emerges as the three elements interact both in harmony and in discord.</p>

<p>The live sounds, comprising of various scrapes, bangs and droning feedback, compliment the movement providing tension as the rhythms become more violent and percussive before suddenly stopping under the instruction of the director.</p>

<p>Through an abstract structure Openbatch create a unique and engaging piece of theatre, forcing their audience to examine their own place in a society which places increasingly less value on the individual.</p>        

<p>An original and ambitious project, as one of the performers states, ‘I know this is new to you but if you understand this you will understand everything’.</p>
