<p><span><em>The Party</em></span> is a double bill of wicked one act satires to mark the election. The first, <em><b>The Honest Politician</b></em>, has MPs swapping wives as secretaries, the second, <em><b>Abominable Suffragettes</b></em>, stars a suffragette on the rampage.</p>

<p><span>Plot outlines:</span></p>

<p>THE HONEST POLITICIAN by Lucy Bell</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">“You’re an MP, Max - not a footballer!”<br />
“Nonsense. The proles like a bit of swagger. That’s why everyone in politics starts in marketing!”</span></p>

<p>In the wake of the expenses scandal, Graham “grapey” Gilmore MP has a crisis of conscience about hiring his wife. Graham’s devious colleague, Max, has the perfect solution: he suggests they swap wives. What Graham doesn’t realise is that Max is already sleeping with his wife and wants his own wife, Esther, in Graham’s camp to spy on him. Life is tough when you are Britain’s only honest MP but Graham is determined to stick to his principles…and with Esther’s help he might just succeed.</p>
<br />

<p>ABOMINABLE SUFFRAGETTES by Suze Gardner</p>
 
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">"When women get the vote things will change, Thomas"<br />
"Damn suffragettes!  Encouraging you to get above yourself, Lilian. God help this country if you do get the vote!"</span></p>
 
<p>Thomas and Lilian are uneasily married. All was fine until she discovered women's rights… which he blames for all the world's wrongs!   She can't cope with being a downtrodden little wife any more and he is embarrassed and furious at her militant behaviour. But it is 1918 and things are changing quickly.  Can Thomas come to terms with the new status quo?
