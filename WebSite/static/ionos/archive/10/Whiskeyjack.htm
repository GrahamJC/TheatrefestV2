<p>Following last year’s Theatrefest debut, Whiskeyjack Productions are pleased to present two more pieces of new writing from Devon based writers:<br /><br />

<span><u>Dubious Practice</u>, by Jeff Sleeman.</span><br />

A comedy, in which Vince, a dentist seizes the opportunity to realise his dream of becoming an actor.  But can his practice survive in the hands of the two young assistants he leaves in charge?</p>

<p><span><u>A Round with Alice</u>,  by Nick Floyd.</span><br />

Evelyn feels it is high time she meets Alice, her son Wentworth’s new girlfriend and invites her round to dinner.  A dark comedy exploring what can happen when a possessive mother is threatened with a rival for her son’s affection.</p><br />

<p>Director  Wendy Carter<br />
Producer Jeff Sleeman.</p>

<p>This will be Jeff Sleeman’s third appearance at the Theatrefest as an actor and his second as a writer and producer. </p>

<p>Wendy Carter has written and directed several short plays for the Northcott Community Company and directed Whiskeyjack’s production at last year’s Theatrefest.</p><br />

<p><span>About Whiskeyjack</span></p>

<p>Whiskeyjack Productions is the umbrella theatre company which produces work by new writers who have attended playwriting courses run by Exeter based playwright Nick Discombe. Whiskeyjack was first created in 2006 when two plays from the course were performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The Exeter Express and Echo described last year’s Whiskeyjack Theatrefest production as “full of charm and fun…and moments of pathos”.
