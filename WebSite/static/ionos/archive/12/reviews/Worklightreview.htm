<h1>How to Start a Riot</h1>
<h2>Worklight Theatre</h2><br />
<p>The London riots in 2011 sent shockwaves throughout the country but what were the psychological reasons behind the mass violence that took place? In this piece the three performers on stage explore a range of possibilities, asking questions to provoke the thoughts of the audience and enable them to form their own opinions based on the facts and theories demonstrated. The performance uses text, torchlight and physical theatre to replicate the civil unrest and the perspectives of the various parties involved, such as the police and the rioters themselves. The acting and pacing of the piece is superb and the audience will leave wanting to ask a few questions of their own.<br />
