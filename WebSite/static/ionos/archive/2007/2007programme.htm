<h2>what's on?</h2>
<p>Three days of hectic and eclectic theatre activity from the profoundly silly to the ridiculously serious and all points in between.<br /><br />  

Shows include:<br /><a href="A-up.htm"> <b>Beach Impediment – Episode 3</b></a> from <b>A Up Productions</b>, centred around the recording of a radio comedy-show, sound effects and all, in front of a 
live audience –  that’s you! <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 14+</b><br /><br />  
<a href="entanglement.htm"><b>Entanglement</b></a>, a mesmerizing piece of contemporary dance from North Devon Dance’s <b>Yo Yo Triptych</b>, reflects all our desires for 
both interdependence and individuality.  The piece also features as part of the county-wide Dance In Devon Festival. <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 7+</b><br /><br />
<a href="Cassandra.htm"><b>Cassandra</b></a>, a hard-hitting contemporary drama based on Greek mythology.  This production
is presented by <a href="http://www.multistorytheatre.co.uk" target="_blank"><b>multi story</b></a> and will be fresh from the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/listing.asp?ev=370" target="_blank">
Brighton Festival Fringe</a> (having already played Fringe Festivals in Canada). <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 14+</b>
<br /><br />
<a href="backstage.htm"><b>Anyone Backstage?</b></a> by Stephanie Easton, presented by the <b>Torrington Players</b>, is a series of affectionate portraits of the back-stage crew – some funny, some straight, 
some sad.  It was a multi-award winner at the recent One Act Play Festival in Exmouth. <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 11+</b><br /><br />
<a href="VGSOH.htm"><b>The Golden Key</b></a> presented by <a href="http://multistorytheatre.co.uk"><b>multi story</b></a> is a high-energy re-telling of George Macdonald's well-loved tale. 
A grand adventure that has entertained audiences across the UK and Canada. <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 5+</b>
<br /><br />

<a href="Surmo.htm"><b>The Great Surmo</b></a> brings you Magic with a Smile - a truly INTERNATIONAL ACT full of  SUSPENSE… MYSTERY AND ILLUSION… <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 5+</b><br /><br />
<a href="whitehippos.htm"><b>Goodbye My Love</b></a> is <b>White Hippo Productions</b>’ sombre comedy about breaking up and making up. <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 14+</b><br /><br />  
<a href="tea.htm"><b>Tea With Lawrence</b></a>, from <b>Footprint Theatre Company</b>, is a light-hearted look at changing views of women at the time of World War 1. In particular 
it focuses on DH Lawrence’s candid view of women’s sexuality in his poem <i>Rose of All The World</i>.  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age 14+</b>   <br /><br />

With some of North Devon’s finest <a href="2007musicians.htm"><b>musicians</b></a> to entertain you in between shows, this is going to be a weekend to savour.  
What’s more ticket prices have been kept ridiculously low to allow you to take a chance on something you might never have experienced before.  At only £3 full price and £2 
concessions here is your opportunity to go out on a limb.  You think you’re allergic to contemporary dance – catch the bug.  Fine with comedy but straight drama’s not for 
you – put it to the test.  Because that is what the Fringe is all about.  With passion and commitment from the performers and a real sense of adventure from the audience 
anything can happen.<br /><br />

The venue for all this excitement is a purpose built studio theatre within <b>The Factory</b>, North Devon College’s newly established music performance facility in an 
industrial unit on the Roundswell Estate.  It provides all the facilities and just the right ambience for an event of this nature.
