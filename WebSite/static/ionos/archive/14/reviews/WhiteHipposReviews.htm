<h1>The Boy Who Fell in Love with the Stars</h1>
<h2>White Hippos productions</h2><br />
<p>So let me just get this out of the way right at the starts. Yes there are pyjamas, handmade and of the rather nifty space themed variety. The man wearing the pyjamas is Mark Ashmore who appears a grown man as we enter the room, welcoming uswarmly with homage to said pyjamas and genuine excitement at making it to his eighth year at the festival. When the lights go down and the animation begins it is as if we see him transform in front of us into the little boy he once was with tales of imaginary adventures into space and beyond.</p>

<p>It is a long time since I have been read a bedtime story and was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. There is obvious family appeal, but I would assert the 'big' kids will like this as much as the little ones! The reason for this has to be really down to Mark's understated and entirely engaging performance. Spoken word is obviously the key medium, but watch for the delightful film projections. I personally loved Mark's interaction with his younger animated self and the way in which both humour and sadness are relayed. Authenic and touching, a real gem of a show absolutely worthy of a place on this year's must-see list.<br /><em>Jemma Clancy, The Daily Fringe</em>
