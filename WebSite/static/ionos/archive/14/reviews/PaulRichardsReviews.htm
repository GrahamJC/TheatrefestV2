<h1>Getting Lost in My Hometown</h1>
<h2>Paul Richards</h2><br />
<p>Before starting his performance, Paul Richards claims that this is the least theatrical of all the offerings at Fringe Theatrefest. With a paper flip chart at his side on stage, it could also be the least technical. ‘Getting Lost in my Hometown’ blends the genres of comedy and theatre, but it also has two things not normally associated with each other: a fast pace and buckets of confidence (a lanky bucket in Richards’ case). As a result the performance and its topics come across as somewhat of an oxymoron: Richards delivers convincingly despite his tales of awkward encounters with women; his inability to assemble furniture, not to mention a tale of being left out from a round of drinks. All of this is unexpected given his confidence!</p> 

<p>‘Getting Lost in my Hometown’ is incidentally about Paul losing his way after a night at the pub, in which he dons various guises of the people he meets and reels off questions from Britain’s most difficult pub quiz. At times admittedly I felt mentally lost with the narrative, but Richards’ performance was charming and funny enough to keep me engaged.<br />
