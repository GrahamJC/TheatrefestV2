<h1>WOMANz</h1>
<h2>Tessa Waters</h2><br />
<p>I went to see Tessa's show last night and the audience definitely entered into the spirit of things!</p>
<p>If you want to see what a bundle of Australian, talented, funny, physical comedy energy, hitting a Barnstaple theatrefest crowd looks like, wearing, at times, not much, come along! I guarantee you will be entertained! From witty and honest observation on subjects as diverse as "Art", "Pubic hair" and "How to dance just about anywhere" to laughing at all our wobbly bits, getting a little bit "pregnant" and going "crazy" this show has it! (Whatever "it" is!) Answering the question of what to do when you fart on the dancefloor, and generally just having a fantastic time on stage and carrying the audience with her. This show rocked! And if you want to know why, go and watch the genius opening sequence!</p>
<p>Great for a night out with friends after a few drinks!<br />

<p>From the weird and wonderful mind of comedian Tessa Waters, comes a physical comedy that is outrageous, hilarious and more than a little bit crazy. WOMANz is intended to make the viewers laugh, give love to them and in the process teach them a few fancy dance moves. It was a success in all three, with almost constant laughter, lots of dancing from Tessa and her audience. It guaranteed that everyone who watched her show absolutely loved it.</p> 

 <p>What this performance does very well is engage with the audience, even when Tessa was transitioning between outfits. Usually this point in a production isn’t known for being particularly funny, and can actually break the flow of a production, yet in WOMANz the transitions from one section to another was seamless and Tessa maintained a constant rhythm throughout. But although it is very funny, the brand of humour in WOMANz might not be to everybody’s taste, especially considering how exaggerated it is. Feedback from the audience seemed very positive overall, probably because WOMANz is based entirely around the interaction between Tessa and her audience. To sum up, WOMANz is an truly hilarious show and Tessa Waters' performance cannot be praised enough.<br />
