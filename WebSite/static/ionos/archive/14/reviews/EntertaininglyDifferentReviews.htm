<h1>Confessions of a Rabbi's Daughter</h1>
<h2>Entertainingly Different</h2><br />
<p>I don't think it is possible to put into words how much I enjoyed this show! The outstanding comedy duo, Rob and Dex put on a performance that is most definitely entertaining and very much different to what I expected from 'The Three Little Pigs' and Little Red Riding Hood'! Puppets, hats, a rubber chicken and a spoon are just some of the props that make an appearance. There are words and there are songs, but most notably there is the delivery by two very talented and competent artists who clearly love what they do.</p> 

<p>This really is laugh-out-loud fun at its very best. The energy and rapport between the performers  was infectious ensuring that even I, the most shy and reluctant of audience participators, was eventually, yes, participating! I cannot remember the last time I laughed so much. I couldn't contain my ridiculous grin and tears of laughter were evidence indeed of genuine appreciation. My one and only criticism was the small size of the audience. So this is where you can help. Go and see this, it is a wonderful show, expertly crafted and delivered. It deserves to be seen and should be seen. Children I am sure will love it, but adults don't be put off. There is absolutely broad appeal to anyone and everyone regardless of age, especially the young at heart.<br /><em>Jemma Clancy, The Daily Fringe</em>
