<h1>Broken Angels</h1>
<h2>Thrice Three Muses</h2><br />
<p>Serious stuff this.</p>
<p>The company are congratulated on tackling the Cinderella of health and well being, mental health. Perhaps rather than referring to mental health in their advertising they should have referred to eating disorders - which was its focus. The show may then have been received by larger audiences. If you, a friend or a loved one are effected by this issue do try to get yourself and them along to the show. It may help to break down the stigma/isolationist barrier that shrouds mental health issues.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>

<p>A clever and well executed view of a Bulimia sufferer's tortured existence. For me there was rather too much shouting ( I have a dislike of "loud") but I'm sure the audience would not have heard whispering lumps.
I would personally have preferred to see a more general overview of mental illness, but I know that Bulimia is "trendy" and more likely to attract attention, and it would have benefited from being advertised as such.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Broken Angels is a piece which looks at the reality of life with an eating disorder. It is a young girl we see on stage, the stereotyped image of the sufferer, if you will. Personally I felt it important however that her voice and ultimately the story relayed attends to the atypical. It is made clear that the disease takes on many forms and impact young and old, male and female, from all walks of life. Knowing the material was based on fact added intensity, which was furthered by the mesmerising performances given by the three actors. A special mention should be given to the understudy who stepped in at the last minute to deliver a truly beautifully authentic interpretation which really added to the performance for me, when it could so easily have detracted. Clearly this is a very carefully researched and considered piece. Devastating in content and delivery, it has been deliberately conceived with the very clear intention of genuine education and awareness promotion.</p>  

<p>The topic of mental health and eating disorders is particular is highly contentious. I would not have chosen to see this piece if I hadn't been reviewing it. Irrespective of one's personal experience and indeed opinion, I would assert that this is a piece that deserves to be seen. Unavoidably this is a piece that is not uniformly appropriate and will challenge and impact uniquely according to the individual. However I personally would urge you to take my lead, choose something that looks like it might not be for you and go see it. I hope you, like me here, will find your experience of this year's festival immeasurably better for it.<br /><em>Jemma Clancy, The Daily Fringe</em>

<p>A really key topic for theatre to address. 10 points to the stand-ins.</p>
<p>Thought provoking. Well acted.</p>
<p>Absolutely superb. Well done. The 3 characters onstage - anna, voice 3 and lump was a good idea. Must see this.  <em>Beth Williams</em></p>
<p>A must see at Barnstaple Fringe 2014. Absolutely brilliant.  Thank you.</p>
<p>Just seen Broken Angels and found it powerful and absorbing. Good pace, really well performed. <em>Caroline Haks</em></p>
<p>Thought provoking.</p>
<p>Incredible insights.  Thank you.</p>
<p>A well addressed issue (shame lump had to rhyme and the character tried to compare it to cancer - too self-involved for much empathy) but a good show. <em>B Chapple</em>
