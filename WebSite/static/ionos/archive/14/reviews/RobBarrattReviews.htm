<h1>Half an hour with Rob Barratt</h1>
<h2>Rob Barratt</h2><br />
<p>Half an Hour with Rob Barratt is exactly what it sounds like: 30 minutes with singer and world class poetic genius, Rob Barratt.  The aims of this production are to make the audience smile and, to use his words, “tickle their brains”. I can’t say for certain whether I came away from his performance with my brain tickled, as I have no idea what that sensation feels like, but what I can say is that his poems are funny, well thought out, unconventional, interesting and at times cheesy, but this only serves to add to the overall charm of his performance. In spite of all this, I do have one major criticism of Half an Hour with Rob Barratt, it was only 30 minutes long! And although Rob Barratt crams as much hilarity into that short space of time as he possibly can, and judging from the all positive feedback he was getting after the show everyone enjoyed it, to me it still feels like not enough of a very good thing. If the performance had gone on for a little while longer, 10 or 20 minutes say, then this production could be considered perfect. As it is Half an Hour with Rob Barratt is still thoroughly enjoyable, and I would strongly recommend it for anyone interested in having their brain tickled.<br />
