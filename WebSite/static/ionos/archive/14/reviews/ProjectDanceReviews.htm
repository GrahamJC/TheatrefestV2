<h1>Throoo... the Gates!</h1>
<h2>Project:  Dance!</h2><br />
<p>Project Dance's show proved their passion for including eveyone in the joy that is Dance.</p>
<p>With feel good sing along songs, and a chance for the audience to join in, but the option not to, this was Project Dance, and it was successful! The performers shone joy and happiness from the stage and made everyone smile. You can tell this show will get better and better and go from strength to strength during the fringe. A true community piece of theatre, inclusive of all ages and dancing abilities "Throo the Gates" showcases Project Dances commitment to fun, and their commitment to our community! Go and support these Dancers!<br /><em>Bryony Chave-Cox</em></p>

<p>Throoo.... the Gates! is a Project Dance production and is, it must be said, a mixed bag.  The performance is a musical story based around a riddle that has puzzled philosophers since time immemorial: can monsters be friends with humans? The dancers answer this question by taking on the roles of monsters, humans and reporters to clue the audience in on what they are watching. Stylistically it was a very diverse production, as it featured a wide range of dancing styles and caters to a multitude of musical tastes, combining 80’s & 90’s pop artists with contemporary ones. One of the show's real strengths is in it's engagement with the audience, getting audience members to dance along rather than just sit and watch.</p> 

<p>There were a couple of small technical difficulties; the music skipped at a couple of inopportune moments in the middle of the dance routines and at points the music was a touch too loud making hearing the performers quite difficult. Project Dance is a community project involving people with of all different ages and abilities and although this means that occasionally the performances are slightly inconsistent, it doesn't matter, because there is huge enthusiasm on stage, which is infectious to it's audience. It is this very feature of the production that makes it a success, the cheer and enthusiasm of the dancers spreading throughout the room and making its viewers happy by osmosis. To conclude Throoo... the Gates! achieves what all good theatre strives to do the world over; it leaves its audience smiling.<br />
