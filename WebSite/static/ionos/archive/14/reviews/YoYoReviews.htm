<h1>Frontline</h1>
<h2>YoYo</h2><br />
<p>With 2012 marking the centenary of world war one, there is perhaps an added timeliness to the subject matter of this piece. Inspired in part by the book Wake by Anna Hope, the premise of this performance is telling the story of three women and how each of their lives are touched by the war and the impending arrival of an unknown soldier to his final resting place. The performance explores the story of a woman who loses her son, a woman who loses a lover, and a sister whose brother returns  but is suffering from shell shock which means she too suffers the loss of the life and relationship she once knew. It is a sad but powerful piece. The interpretation and focus on human relationships give the piece appeal beyond the abstract and historical. I would urge dance and non-dance fans alike to go and see it.</p>

<p>The staging is ostensibly minimal but in fact incredibly intricate and cleverly done. There are ample cues simultaneously obvious and yet subtle. I was continually engaged with this piece and I found that I was transfixed from start to finish. I felt I was in part making as well as following their stories. I found I was thinking continually, I was involved in the making of meaning without it being distracting. It was a piece I know I could quite happily watch again and again, each time with enjoyment and making new discoveries not seen before.</p>

<p>I feel it important to mention that the music was composed especially for this piece. The composers intimate understanding of each dance, character and their story is evidence. The choreography and performance is stunning in its own right and for me, framed and extending perfectly by its score. A truly beautiful and moving piece, excellently done.<br /><em>Jemma Clancy, The Daily Fringe</em>
