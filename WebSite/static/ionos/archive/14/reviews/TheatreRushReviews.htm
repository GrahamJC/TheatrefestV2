<h1>The Lost Tales of Devon</h1>
<h2>Theatre Rush</h2><br />
<p>Lost Tales of Devon is brought to Barnstaple fringe by Theatre Rush – an excellent performance, with beautiful storytelling and fun moments of madness. The three skilled performers immediately  build rapport with each other and with the audience. The audience are taken across Devon in search of stories - the scene of the county is set through beautiful passages of text that are well performed. These moments of description are interspersed with comedy and silliness. The costumes, like the performers, are instantly appealing and engaging and characters are quickly created in the 'costume department' – nothing is hidden from the audience. The piece is incredibly engaging and well-crafted and the performers are free in their delivery. By responding to things in the moment the competence of the performers allows them to make the most of the unexpected in a fun and playful way.</p> 

<p>The audience are involved in the finding and telling of tales in the same fun, gentle and playful way. The effortless creation of a story with the audience means that the performers can never be quite sure of how some of the stories will turn out, but the company seem to have developed have fail safe ways to engage the audience.</p> 

<p>Overall the simple local stories are told beautifully told and brought to life with vibrant performances. This performance is full of fun, playful energy. A must see for children and adults.<br />
