<h1>Snakes! the Musical</h1>
<h2>Quite Nice Theatre</h2><br />
<p>Snakes! The Musical is a Quite Nice Theatre production and is by far and beyond one of the most catchy and funny musicals that has appeared in the Fringe Theatre Festival. The audience participation was exceptional, with the performers interacting with and actually moving among their viewers.  The musical was a tad lengthy, but because it was so well rounded and consistently funny throughout the audience was never bored by it, the interval between the songs being just as hilarious as the songs themselves.</p>
<p>Snakes! The Musical aims to entertain its audience, and with a combination of truly outrageous characters, individual comedy from the three actors and very well written songs, this production has achieved that goal and more. Snakes! The Musical was also intended to be an exploration of musical theatre itself, asking the question whether it is actually worth it by using the using the hurdles and problems that the director is faced with - a need for a 50 million donation and a rival for the affections of the male lead are just two of those problems.</p>
<p>To conclude Snakes! The Musical is truly wonderful, it is entertaining, very well thought out and manages to answer the question of whether musical theatre is worth it: it is!<br /><em>George Chapman, The Daily Fringe</em>
