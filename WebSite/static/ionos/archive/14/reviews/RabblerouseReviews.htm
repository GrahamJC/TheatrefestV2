<h1>Breakers</h1>
<h2>Rabblerouse Theatre</h2><br />
<p>Breakers is a great piece of theatre I certainly enjoyed watching and would very happily recommend. Billed as a story that explores the relationship between man and machine I came to the performance intrigued by how modern day Sophie and nineteenth century George's stories would be told. I was not disappointed and most certainly that is because of the superb acting we witnessed. The show's four actors take on seven different characters with ease. It was a joy to watch them seamlessly inhabit the different roles each with an authenticity, fantastic stage presence and ultimately acting skill. I was really endeared to Sophie's character and so enjoyed her interaction with Raymondo in particular!</p> 

<p>George's story was one I had missed from my history lessons, so it was great to learn something new too! The intensity from both Michael and Georgia in their roles was fab. Finally, I really enjoyed too how the script had been put together and the transitions staged. Such different stories in some ways, but also quite similar in others. Really enjoyed this, definitely worth catching if you can!<br />
