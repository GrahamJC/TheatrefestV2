<h1>Poetry Ping Pong</h1>
<h2>Daniel Haynes and Robert Garnham</h2><br />
<p>Two familiar faces from past Fringe’s, Daniel Haynes and Robert Garnham are both very bright and very funny poets. Bringing an exciting new twist to the standard spoken word performance, we see Daniel and Robert in competition with one another as they fight to be declared Poetry Ping Pong Champion. With the help of a futuristic Bruce Forsyth and tinfoil ping pong balls, the two battle it out, but with this performance there are no losers. The laid back attitude of the pair makes for a chilled out, fun atmosphere that allows the audience to immediately feel comfortable and engaged right from the offset. Robert’s cheekily witty performance set against Daniel’s droll, deadpan delivery is enthralling to watch and is sustained by the evident pleasure both take in the show. As well as being masterfully performed, it is delightful to see the support each of the performers give to one other throughout. This creates a strong relationship between the two and thus, also with the audience. A jam-packed, creative and original performance of fantastic spoken word. Poetry Ping Pong had me laughing the entire way through and wishing for more. A must see!<br />

<p>I finished my first fringe on a high with this one. Two poets of different styles complementing each other well. If poetry had been so entertaining, clever and witty when I was at school maybe I would not have been 60 before I attended my first poetry recital.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>

<p>An amusing end to my first Fringe Theatrefest.</p> 
<p>These two performers batted their poetry to and fro in a unique fashion.</p>
<p>While this style of presentation is not entirely my cup of coffee, I could (and did) appreciate the poetry skills of these bards.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
