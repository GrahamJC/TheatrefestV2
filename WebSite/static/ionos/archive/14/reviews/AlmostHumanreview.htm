<h1>Dante Undone</h1>
<h2>Almost Human</h2><br />
<p>Dante Undone is an experimental performance, which features live film making and offers a fascinating re-imagining of Dante's Divine Comedy. There are many layers to this performance (perhaps reflecting Dante's multi-layered hell). The audience are simultaneously submerged into the mechanics of the production of the film, whilst watching the projection that is being made. This takes the audience a little while to adjust to, there is a huge amount to see and the audience's focus is split between the film, the film making, the props, the performers and the sets. Surprisingly the multitude of elements do not detract from one another, instead there is a satisfaction in simultaneously experiencing the making and the made.</p>   

<p>The film itself can at moments be disturbing, as you would expect an interpretation of hell to be, but it is also fun. As attention settles into watching the careful and beautiful film and film making, the audience can begin to pay more attention to the beautifully scripted soundtrack. The writing brings together cultural and political comment, moments of light and dark and humour and depth.</p>
 
<p>This performance offers great depth, thought and intelligence, through the content, the structure and risk-taking style of the performance. Although this might not appeal to everyone on paper, I found that despite having no prior knowledge of Dante's work, my enjoyment of the production was not lessened. So if you engage with the experience of Dante Undone you will find amusing and fascinating ideas of what hell could be in a truly unique performance.<br />
