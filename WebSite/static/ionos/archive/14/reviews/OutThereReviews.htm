<h1>Smidge</h1>
<h2>Out There Theatre</h2><br />
<p>‘Smidge’ is a piece that proves that sometimes less is more, delightfully filling an empty stage with a goodie bag full of imagination. Expertly performed hand shadow puppetry, colourful imagery and childlike playfulness makes this performance a joy to watch. From the beginning, Tom Bosworth’s endearing vocal performance as imaginary friend Smidge, combined with Phil Murphy’s physical performance, engages the audience and draws us into the higgledy piggledy imagination of a young child, Jess. As well as displaying the intelligent creativity behind the piece, the disembodied voice of Smidge reinforces the characters fictitious nature and is a clever device to keep the character’s existence inside Jess’ head, with the audience being granted a special privilege to see Smidge with their eyes too. The success of this is down to the wonderful collaboration between the two actors who play Smidge. The duo are perfectly in sync with each other throughout, bringing Smidge into our world in his own right, so much so that at one point, I had to remind myself he was not actually real. A few moments within the piece need to be slightly tightened up, but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Wonderfully performed by all involved, ‘Smidge’ is a whimsical, nostalgic piece that manages to portray the world through a child’s eyes with love and care, and provides a possible answer to where imaginary friends go when a child grows up. A show for all ages, make sure you don’t miss it!<br />
