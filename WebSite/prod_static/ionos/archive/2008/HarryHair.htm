<p><b>Harry Hair</b>, entertainer extraordinaire, enjoys himself enormously performing in front of his audience. Unfortunately his shows don't
always go quite as planned....</p>
<p>The comedy is subtle provoking double-chinned laughter.</p>
<p>Harry Hair Cabaret Show is being performed for the first time in England here at the North Devon Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>Written and performed by Anthony Trahair<br />
Directed by Piero Partigianoni
<br /><br />
Anthony Trahair was born in London but grew up in Cornwall. He has
been in Europe since 1996 and owes his professional training to
numerous years of street performing, combined with his recent studies
at the Dimitri Theatre School in Switzerland - a school of movement
theatre and theatrical creation from which he graduated, after three
years of intense work, in 2006.</p><br />
<p><b>modern clown comedy<br />
all ages</b><br />
fundamentally for adults but children also enjoy this crazy Harry Hair character!</p>
