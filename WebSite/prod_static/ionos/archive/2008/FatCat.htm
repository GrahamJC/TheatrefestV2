<p>Jane Leakey of <b>Fat Cat Theatre Company</b> brings you the stories of some of the exciting animals who live at Shapwick Nature Reserve and provides a fantastic opportunity to meet the inhabitants "up close and personal".</p>
<p>Delightful puppets bring the story to life - Jack the rat, Buddy the mink, Emily the watervole and Harry the heron. Jane has spent the summer researching these wonderful creatures and making some fantastic puppets which both children and adults will love.</p>
<p>Jane was really excited to be given the opportunity to write the new show, specially commissioned by English Nature: "Sometimes it is tricky to see wild animals up close. That is why puppets are so brilliant in giving children the opportunity to meet the Shapwick wildlife face to face. I find that young audiences gain a great deal of knowledge when they meet my characters, while having fun at the same time. We are hoping that after meeting with my puppets, the children will be inspired to go to Shapwick to look at the real thing. I am particularly excited about Roger the otter, as Shapwick is one of the best places in the UK to see otters; it's a joy to bring him and all the other creatures to life on the stage."</p>
<p>As well as a host of furry friends, the show also features Doris the dragonfly (a would-be opera singer) and Nigel the pike. So lots to look forward to!</p><br />
