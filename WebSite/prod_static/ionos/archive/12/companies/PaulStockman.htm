<p>Paul Stockman is one of the world's leading psychological entertainers. He had a great success at Fringe TheatreFest last year and is now back with Part 2!</p>
<p>With performances on stage and television around the world,  from New York to Las Vegas and from London to Paris, this show is one of the  most fascinating, fun and enjoyable nights of theatre you will experience.</p>
<p><em>"If  you like Derren Brown you will love this."</em> The Times </p>
<p>Many will recognise this gifted performer from his  television appearances on The BBC, ITV, Sky Television and most recently, as  the resident Psychological expert on Channel 4&rsquo;s popular show, Big Brother. </p>
<p>This is guaranteed to be a unique evening of entertainment  that mixes Psychology, Suggestion, Intuition and Misdirection, to give the  illusion of real psychic abilities. </p>
<p>THERE ARE NO  ACTORS OR STOOGES USED IN THIS SHOW!</p>
<p>Paul does not claim to have any special powers. This makes  his performance even more intriguing, as he takes his audience into a world of  Mind blowing demonstrations that will have you contemplating how it was done for  years after you have witnessed this very special show.</p>
<p><em>"From  dark and mysterious, to fun and light hearted, this show has it all."</em> The Guardian</p>
<p>Paul recently returned from performing in the capital of  entertainment, Las Vegas where he performed alongside many of the world&rsquo;s  leading entertainers in his field.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Paul&rsquo;s likeable persona, mixed with his friendly approach,  guarantees that no one is ever made to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed in any  way. </p>
<p><em>"DON'T  MISS THIS!&nbsp; Rarely do we get a chance to witness something so amazing"</em>  USA Today</p>
<p><em>"Paul  is a true expert in human nature and behaviour"</em> Channel 4 Television </p>
