<h1>Tea Anyone?</h1>
<h2>Pidge Productions</h2>
<br />
<p>Tea Anyone?  Is an upbeat, funny and uplifting play about two people who try to make The  Boston Tea Party Theatre feel more like a place unlike any other: home. This  show, brought to you by Pidge productions, will make you laugh, make you smile,  make you want a cup of tea and yet all the while make you think about a handful  of questions that you may not have considered before, about some of the most  important topics in today&rsquo;s society: what is it that makes a place feel more  like a home? How do you get guests to leave a house warming party? And finally,  the most important question of all: Tea Anyone?<br />
  <em>Fringe Secrets</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very intimate and imaginative production that explores the values and definitions of 'Home' using props such as tape, an old TV and audience members. Very funny and entertaining!<br /><em>Pete Buffery</em></p>
