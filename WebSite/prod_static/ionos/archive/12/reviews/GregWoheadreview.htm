<h1>I like the way you wear your hair</h1>
<h2>Greg Wohead</h2>
<br />
<p>A simple idea which was incredibly well executed. it was an effective and beautifully crafted story. definitely recommend this one to watch.<br /><em>Michelle England</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A touching and powerful personal story about a simple rite of passage everyone knows. Greg draws you in to his teenage world with lightness and humour, the result is something evocative and rather beautiful. Told with projections and a great sound track, you can really feel that balmy Texas heat and the importance of that defining moment we all know...
Theatre and Storytelling with honesty, lightness and understatement.<br /><em>Wendy Quelch</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the intimate setting of Venue X, we are invited to share the experience of American school boy, Greg during the long hot Texan summer of 1998. Through a clever use of lighting effects, we accompany Greg as he takes us on a tour of his town, his home and his family. We share with him the moment when he crosses the fine line from boyhood dreams to adult reality.  We are party to Greg’s memories of playing in the Poteet College Band alongside his fellow band members and the girl of his dreams, Sarah. Greg longs to ask Sarah out and takes advice from his two best friends as to the best way to achieve his goal. And then, just as he thinks it has all gone horribly wrong, Sarah calls him...<br />
