<h1>Purgatory Passengers</h1>
<h2>Autojeu</h2><br />
<p>Purgatory Passengers is a hilarious and ridiculous one man comedy in which talented performer, Sam Gibbs, transforms himself into the various characters he finds in an airport. The characters appear, fully formed and seemingly out of nowhere – with just Sam's extraordinary physicality and voice creating each and every one.</p>

<p>The performance is fast paced but not rushed, so the characters are allowed to play out. As a result each scenario is taken way beyond its logical conclusion, which ensures that every moment of comedy can be enjoyed by the audience. The show is high energy, which means that it potentially could be chaotic if it wasn't for the relaxed precision of the performance and the known patterns which are built up throughout.</p>

<p>The outrageous comedy and characters are balanced out beautifully by moments where Sam comes out of character to comment. Knowing looks, half said apologies and raised eyebrows made the audience feel welcome and cared for, which is vital in The Room at the Top., which is such an intimate performance space. The audience interaction is perfectly handled and really enhances the the comedy of the ridiculous situation being played out on stage. A wonderful performance that will leave you feeling energised and uplifted.<br /><em>Jess Burford-Redgrove, The Daily Fringe</em>
