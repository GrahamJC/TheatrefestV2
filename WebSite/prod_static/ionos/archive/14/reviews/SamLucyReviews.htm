<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h2>Sam and Lucy</h2><br />
<p>Two young ladies with bags of energy and talent. My, can they dance! For a traditionalist outside of his comfort zone and not 100% sure what was going on, this was a nice half hour. Well done Sam and Lucy.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at their facebook event page and seeing that we were invited to bring party poppers to the performance I strongly suspected what I would witness was going to be just a little different to what I had been expecting! Yes it is dance, but it is also more. Welcome features spoken word, it is immersive and it has a specific physicality which defines the piece and gives the performance a unique appeal. Sam and Lucy made their audience feel very welcome. They cleverly and competently relay their stories. Their interaction was great, as was their use of space. On top of this, the choreography and energy was absolutely captivating.</p> 

<p>Inspired by the dancers’ own experiences and differing relationship with North Devon, the piece could resonate with the each audience member's own links to the area. Above all else it was a fun and engaging insight into the lives and thoughts of these fabulously creative performers. For me this was a piece which showed maturity and a professionalism beyond what might reasonably be expected of such recent graduates! At the same time it was youthfully exuberant and an absolute joy to watch. I suspect this is just the beginning for this very talented duo and I for one look forward to following their careers as they develop. A definite must see, do be sure to catch it!<br />

<p>Two very talented dancers, who wove a tale of welcome to Devon. This was an entertaining half-hour. I did not hear everything that they were saying when they spoke across each other, but that is my problem not theirs. Well choreographed and visually enjoyable.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
