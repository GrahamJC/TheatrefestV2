<h1>Meet the Real Maggie Thatcher</h1>
<h2>Gerundagula Productions</h2><br />
<p>Told through personal recollections from a variety of characters, the proposed truth about Maggie Thatcher is put forward for your opinion. Mike Francis Carvalho performs this one man show with class and confidence, tactfully and sensitively stepping through a multitude of thoughts and feelings towards one of the most talked about Prime Ministers. Surprisingly funny and upbeat, all sides of the story are represented in equal measure without being afraid to challenge and push your own judgements too. Although some characters are stronger than others, there is no denying that Carvalho has an impressive ability to transform himself from one character to the next, achieving a wide range of accents and physicality’s. The hard work and dedication that has gone into this performance is clear, as fact after fact about Thatcher’s reign was seamlessly woven into the text, although the interludes between characters need to run more smoothly in order to keep up with the energy that the rest of the show is delivered in. An educational and evocative piece that resonates especially well with those who were affected by Thatcher, but is equally just as entertaining for those who weren’t.<br /><em>

<p>Brilliant - really captured the Thatcher era. I was in Barnsley during the miners' strike in '84. I really relived it this evening!<br /><em>Deborah Preston</em></p>
