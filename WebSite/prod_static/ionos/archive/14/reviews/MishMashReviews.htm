<h1>Quint-essentially Spectacular Vernacular!</h1>
<h2>Mishmash Productions</h2><br />
<p>Well what can I say... It was fantastic!! I was blown away by the talent of the local artists. Such a mixed bag of acts in such a short space of time. A thoroughly enjoyable evening and well worth the money.<br /><em>Felicity Cornish</em></p>
<br />
<p>Mishmash has out done itself for a fifth year. This show boasts an extraordinary ensemble cast with: outstanding pieces, amazing pace, and a level of diversity not found outside of an audition line up for Britain's Got Talent.</p> 
<p>That said, this line up really does have talent ranging from poetry prop-master general, Robert Garnham to the quirky, clever and honest observations of Tim King. This is a show that really does have something for everyone - even the most ADD among us will not notice the time passing as we wonder through the imaginations of this eclectic group on its way to a truly climactic ending.<br /><em>Paul Reisbach</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Spectacular Vernacular was an exceptional show when it was first introduced to the Fringe Theatre Festival, and every year since the production has gone from strength to strength. Now in its fifth year, Quint-Essentially Spectacular Vernacular has reached an unrivalled quality in poetic skill and witty wordplay, making it one of the best shows this year. One of the aims of this production is to exceed expectations, and since I had very high hopes for this show since becoming enamoured with it last year, I am glad to say it was even better than I thought it would be. Another thing that Spectacular Vernacular tries to achieve is to give its audience something they haven’t seen before and, although this has led to some truly spectacular poems, it did also make for uncomfortable listening in one or two of the later poems. However this is personal preference and is not a criticism of how the poems were presented. Another minor complaint is that unfortunately the oppressive heat in the gallery distracted from the performance at times, but was hardly the fault of the performers. All in all, Quint Essentially is what Spectacular Vernacular has always been: very funny, very edgy and very highly recommended.<br /><em>
