<h1>Life Deconstructed</h1>
<h2>Two Seats Four Cheeks</h2><br />
<p>Life Deconstructed, can be summarised in one word: Brilliant! With nothing more than a random text from the audience to base their work around, Two Seats Four Cheeks manages to fill 45 minutes with pure hilarious improv, which is a considerable feat in itself. The show didn’t have any fancy presentation techniques or gimmicks, just two seats, two improvisers and a great deal of humorous characters and scenarios. The main goals of the performance was to amuse, effect and emotionally move the audience, by creating characters that were believable and firmly grounded in reality. Life Deconstructed manage to perform all of these objectives perfectly, adding just the right spice of craziness and silliness to their scenarios to make them funny, whilst at the same time still furnishing them with emotive depth. There were a few suspicions about the performance, with some of the viewers wondering if the audience member who was asked to read out their text message was a plant by the performers, but as I was the one who read it aloud, I can say with certainty that it wasn’t planted by Two Seats Four Cheeks. There were no plants and no tricks played, the improvisers in Life Deconstructed were just that good.<br /><em>

<p>Very, very funny. My wife and I connected to their sketches on obsessive emailing and noodles, in the performance that we attended, in a very personal way! This show is worth 45 minutes of anybody's life.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this improvisation. Who does not know someone who is similar to the ones represented by the performers? I found this was "spot on" and extremely well executed. Having a technology obsessed son & a Chinese noodle-obsessed daughter-without-law the sketch took on a very personal flavour for me. The performers may have thought they were portraying extremes, which made the performance even funnier.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
