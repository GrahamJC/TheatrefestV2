<h1>Women of an Uncertain Age</h1>
<h2>Flip Webster and Maggie Bourgein</h2><br />
<p>Welcomed back to the Fringe for a second time, Flip Webster and Maggie Bourgein return to bring you a series of sketches that point out the humorous reality of getting, just a little bit, older. Kicking things off with a song and dance number, the ladies showcase their wittiness and self-deprecating humour. This, combined with their comfort at interacting with the audience, makes for a confident and relaxed performance. Resonating well with both men and women over a certain age, their sketches have been clearly well thought through and earnestly rehearsed, although at times the delivery of some jokes lets the material down.  Unfortunately, a technical glitch perfectly timed with a costume malfunction, resulting in a halt in the performance that couldn’t be ignored. In a moment that could shake a performer, Flip and Maggie showed their strength at relating to the audience by diffusing the situation with competence and humour. Once both issues were resolved, they returned to the sketch with great enthusiasm and professionalism, without a hint of being overcome by the situation. Two bold performers who are eager to get you laughing, no matter what happens.<br />

<p>If you like knockabout comedy and singing you would probably love this one. It was not my cup of tea - but that is just my taste, and from the positive reaction the performance was getting from most of the audience, a minority one. Mrs Seal enjoyed the performance.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>

<p>I enjoyed this one, and found the sentiments to be "spot on". The ladies gave a very good performance, rather more slapstick than I would have preferred, but the subject matter almost demands this.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
