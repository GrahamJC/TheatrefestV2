<h1>Miss Givings</h1>
<h2>A'Nother Productions</h2><br />
<p>A’nother Productions presents Miss Givings: a funny, engaging and music-full musical that tells the story of Anita Boult, a music star struggling to find her breakthrough role. The play was slightly delayed, entirely understandable, because Debbie Bridge’s car was almost clamped! Once she did get started however, Debbie’s outstanding performance quickly drew the audience’s undivided attention to her, and held it for the duration of the hour long musical, which for a one person show, is quite an accomplishment. The position of the lighting was unfortunate, as it shone in the eyes of the audience directly opposite, but that was only a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding production.</p>

<p>The intention behind Miss Givings was to provide entertainment, but also introduce songs to the audience that they might not have encountered before and give them a new appreciation for music. It is my opinion that the musical Miss Givings achieved both of these objectives, entertaining the audience through the beauty of Debbie’s voice, through her constant engagement with the audience during the production and incorporating songs that, I for one, had never heard before.  All in all Miss Givings is one of the brightest jewels that this year’s Fringe Theatre Festival has to offer and is a must see for anyone 13 and up.<br />
