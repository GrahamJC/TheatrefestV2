<h1>Confessions of a Rabbi's Daughter</h1>
<h2>Emily Rose</h2><br />
<p>Rachel is at the crossroads of her love life in the one-woman piece about religion, family, strength and that all important choice - does she marry the seemingly perfect guy or abandon him for a life with best friend Sarah? This is a musical theatre piece unique to 2014’s Theatrefest. Performer Emily Rose is accompanied on stage by twinkly piano music that sometimes overbears her pleasant if light voice. When the powerful sections of the songs do arrive, they are sung attentively and with purpose.</p> 
<p>The melodies are interjected with spoken narrative that is peppered with sarcastic quips that enhances the otherwise melancholy first half of the performance. Rachel is a character you can relate to, particularly in the tune ‘Nod and Smile’. She may be uncomfortable as the Rabbi’s daughter and vulnerable to being isolated from her family, but Rachel is a role model who no longer wishes to be “stuck in a cage for the rest of my life”.</p>  
<p>Only good words can be said about Sarah, but after this, you’ll have only good words for ‘Confessions of a Rabbi’s Daughter’.<br /><em>

<p>A lovely, funny bittersweet tale sung and spoken to perfection by Emily. Okay she was drowned by the music in places. Why do people have to be so judgmental and expect everyone to fit the same hole as they do? This play must have struck a chord with many, for a variety of reasons (who has not been outside the circle at some time?) - and challenges us all to examine our own consciences as to how we react to and treat people 'different' from the 'norm'.<br /><em>Glyn Seal</em></p>

<p>For me, this was the highlight of the whole Fringe experience. I could have sat and listened to this young lady's poignant performance all evening. She has a beautiful voice, and superbly portrayed the difficulties of finding oneself to be "different" and the potential personal costs of being true to yourself. A very well written and performed piece.<br /><em>Hazel Seal</em></p>
