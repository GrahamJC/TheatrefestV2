<p>On November 22nd 1963, while campaigning for support in Dallas, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated. A suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, was swiftly arrested and charged. Two days later in the basement of the Dallas Police Department a local nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, gunned him down live on national television.</p>

<p>More than fifty years later the speculation continues.</p>

<p>Kennedy: A beacon for peace or a man whose recklessness brought the world to the tipping-point for nuclear destruction? The proud family man on the cover of the glossy magazines or a drug-dependent sex addict behind closed doors? An incorruptible master statesman or a president in office because of massive vote rigging?</p>

<p>Oswald: Lone nut or unwitting patsy? Committed communist or CIA asset?</p> 

<p>No such debate exists for Ruby. The label "the Mafia's man in Dallas" has stuck fast. A blunt, underworld weapon used to silence Oswald. A piece that fits the puzzle.</p>

<p>No one asks if Jack Ruby fits the piece.</p>

<p>This show is underpinned by on-the-record evidence - statements at Ruby's trial, his testimony to the Warren Commission, responses to psychiatric & polygraph testing and messages secreted out of the Dallas County Jail.</p>

<p>It's a story you won't have heard.</p>

<b>Reviews</b></p>
<p><b>The List</b><br />
"Killer portrait from writer-performer Clifford Barry...cleverly conceived and smartly
executed...a pleasingly complex dramatic study that’s in turn funny, abhorrent and
poignant, Barry’s portrayal of Ruby is absolutely terrific...as much about the man as the
conspiracy theories, the show both provokes and engages."<br /></p>
<p><b>Broadway Baby</b><br />
"the depth of research that went into this production shines through...Barry develops a
character that is incredibly well rounded and complex and thoroughly believable...deeply
moving and disturbing with moments of intensely brilliant acting. This portrayal of a
deluded man questions the very justice system we rely on. Was Jack Ruby a communist?
A gangster? A psychotic killer? A patriotic hero? Barry leads us to these questions but
leaves us to make up our own minds about this complicated and interesting man."</p>
<p><b>FringeReview</b><br />
"a top drawer character study, laced with dark humour...a poised physical performance full
of authority, well paced and directed, posing tough questions about truth and lies, about
impulsiveness and compulsion, about conspiracy and anti-semitism...Ruby's life is a
tragedy, but Barry shares this life with humanity, humour and a depth of research and
erudition in writing that renders it into a classy solo production. Highly recommended -
you'll be held in thrall from start to finish."</p>
<p><b>Plays International</b><br />
"I wish this wonderful show could have been longer...the excellence of this self-penned
script and the manner in which the actor inhabits the role leave us in no doubt about
Ruby: like his hero, he asked himself what he could do for his country and found the
answer."</p>
<p><b>FringeGuru</b><br />
"a sympathetic and nuanced view of Ruby: an almost tragic figure, a bystander caught up
in someone else’s tale. Barry cuts a commanding presence...there was one moment,
when he looked me in the eyes, that I felt a stab of genuine fear... As the JFK rumour mill
whirls on and on, Ruby’s been celebrated, pilloried, venerated and defamed, so it’s high
time we heard some words of his own. I listened to those words and I actually believed
them."</p>
<p><b>Counter Culture UK</b><br />
"This show is engrossing on so many levels, almost overwhelming in the amount of
information packed into every expression, gesture and phrase. Clifford Barry is utterly
convincing as Jack Ruby."</p>
<p><b>The Sci-Fi Bulletin</b><br />
"Mesmerising...Barry inhabits and humanises Ruby, a man slowly disintegrating before
our eyes, physically and mentally. It’s a bravura performance. Verdict: Rush to see Ruby."
Buxton Fringe Review (Nominated for Best Actor)
"utterly compelling...a vivid and visceral piece of theatre. Clifford Barry is nothing short of
superb.”
