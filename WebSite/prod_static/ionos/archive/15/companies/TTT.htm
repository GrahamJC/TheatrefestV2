<p>This will be the first time that Scott and Hannah have performed in Fringe TheatreFest and both are very excited to be performing with their new company, <b>TicTac Theatre</b>, in <b>The Open Couple</b>.</p>

<p><b>TicTac Theatre</b> (which stands for Two Is Company, Three’s A Crowd Theatre) specialises in two-handers and multi-role plays. Its ethos is to use the foundations of their training at Cygnet where the emphasis is on character-driven story telling. Using minimal set, Hannah and Scott wish to draw attention to the text and action of the play.</p>

<p>This production of <b>The Open Couple</b> is to be the first in a growing repertory of classical and contemporary plays as part of their new touring company and will be touring the UK throughout 2015.</p>

<p>Dario Fo’s Farcical Drama <b>The Open Couple</b> is a play of boundaries; whether that is within the characters’ own inhibitions, or the literal playing area of the stage in which the fourth wall is tested rigorously. <b>The Open Couple</b> mixes mind games, miscommunication and emotional blackmail with hilarious consequences in this draughty, open marriage.</p>

<p>Filled with heightened physical drama and sharp witty dialogue, this play will carry you through a bent reality of one couple’s fight for their own ideal marriage. Can either person win this game, without abiding by the rules?</p>

<p>This production is directed by Jacquie Crago; voice coach for National Theatre productions <b>One Man Two Governors</b> and <b>Warhorse</b>. As well as an actor and director Jacquie has also been Head of Voice at Oxford School of Drama, Voice Co-ordinator for Birmingham School of Acting and a Vocal Coach for the RSC.</p>
