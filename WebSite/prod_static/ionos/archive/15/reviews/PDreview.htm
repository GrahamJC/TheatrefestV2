<h1>The Big Purple & Green Project:Dance! Time Machine</h1>
<h2>Project:Dance!</h2><br />
<p>In The Big Green and Purple Project: Dance! Time Machine, Project: Dance! Really did take us on a whirlwind tour through the ages, through dance. The piece was cleverly written and choreographed to demonstrate all Project: Dance! ‘s talents and skills, showing the absolute best from their performers. Project: Dance aim to be very inclusive of all skills and ability and their choreography is incredibly successful in this - they show every performers strength.</p>

<p>What shone through to me as an audience member was how much the performers all enjoyed themselves, and it made it a real pleasure to watch. Not only were the performers enjoying themselves, but the audience members were too; the cheers after every dance were a testament to the performers.</p>

<p>The key element to the performance was audience participation – the time machine won’t work unless you join in! The audience were fully engaged and included every step of the way on the journey through time.</p>

<p>Overall, the performance was a pleasure to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a bit of fun! I’m sure I’m not the only one who left the theatre itching to break out the leg warmers, and have a dance!<br /><em>The Daily Fringe</em>
