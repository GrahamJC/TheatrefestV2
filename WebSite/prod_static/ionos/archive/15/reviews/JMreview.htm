<h1>Red Flag over Bermondsey</h1>
<h2>Journeymen Theatre</h2><br />
<p>Red Flag over Bermondsey is a one person narrative developed by Journeymen Theatre which provides the audience with a look into one of the lesser known historical figures: Ada Salter.</p><p>From the introduction onwards it was apparent that we, the audience, were going to be treated to a very well written and rehearsed theatre piece. We were quickly immersed into the Bermondsey slums and the the turbulent changes that were occurring as the insanity of world war one hit home, as well as the private and intimate moments of Ada’s life, that speak volumes about her character and her personal struggles as a woman with high ambitions.</p>
<p>Now, this is generally the point in a review where a few loose threads are tugged upon but honestly there was not a single thing that could have been improved or any area of the performance that needed further work. The exposition was executed very well, seamlessly moving from one point in the story to the next, without disrupting the general narrative or the interest that the audience held for Ada Salter. The props, though used sparingly, were also put to good use in establishing the passage of time in the story and, at one point in the production, were used to show that though Salter was finally being heard, her successes hadn’t changed her ideals. The technical support was also very good with the use of sound effects being important to the immersion of the piece, an aspect that might have spoiled the experience had it not been completely in sync.</p>
<p>In short, Red Flag over Bermondsey gets a strong recommendation because it does everything right and has exceeded already high expectations.
