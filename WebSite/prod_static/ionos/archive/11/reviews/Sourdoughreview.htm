<h1>Hometowns</h1>
<h2>SourDough Theatre</h2><br />
<p>I really enjoyed this show! Some great ideas and suggestions and questions about what home incorporates and fantastic ways of telling us about it using lots of innovative methods. Sit near the front ,somewhere where you'll get a good view, this will help you make the most of the visuals which were great but some of them were a bit tricky to see. Excellent storytelling but not in the traditional sense of the word, and thought provoking too. What is home, where is home, why is that home?<br />Well done! This show had just the right amount of everything funny in places and dealing with a complicated subject well ! Go and see it! Last showing 7:30-8:15 (and don't worry if you were hoping to see the 8:15 theatrefest show, I happen to know they're letting in latecomers! ;-) )<br />

<p>Sour Dough Theatre&rsquo;s wonderful use of shadow puppets will encourage you to look at your personality and question your heritage.</p>
<p>A performance of intrigue, which uses an eclectic mix of media and energy for a stunning effect.</p>
<p>This   youthful production incorporates music from Enya, film, monologue,   debate, and a brave character &lsquo;Joe&rsquo; which we can all identify with.</p>
<p>Is it the monotony of everyday life that makes a place your home? Or the ties that link you to family and friends?</p>
<p>Hometowns will leave you viewing even Weetabix in a whole new light!<br /><em>Fringe Secrets</em></p>
