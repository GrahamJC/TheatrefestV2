<p>Reg Meuross is described as a ‘master storyteller’. Using clever and imaginative lyrics, Reg has earned his reputation as one of the most talented folk/roots musicians around. From gigging in village halls to playing The Royal Albert Hall, where Mike Harding introduced him on stage as “one of the finest singer-songwriters this country has produced”; Reg consistently delights his audiences with songs of life, love and injustice; soulfully delivered with melodic high-tenor vocals and exemplary guitar playing which draw you into his music.</p>
<p>Armed with a collection of original self-penned songs taken from five critically acclaimed albums, this show explores events that influenced the lives of some extraordinary men and women through history including Tom (the poet Thomas Chatterton), Dick (Turpin) and Harry (Farr), the 1st World War soldier, shot by his comrades for ‘cowardice’; The Shakers, The Pilgrim Fathers, Jesus, Elvis, Johnny Ray and and Reg’s Dad! These beautiful songs are also inspired by Reg’s own experiences; sometimes they’re just great stories expertly told and linked by wry, witty observations, but all are complimented by wonderful vocals, guitar, tenor guitar and dulcimer playing.</p>
