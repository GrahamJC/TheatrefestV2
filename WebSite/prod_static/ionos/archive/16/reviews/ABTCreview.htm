<h1>Travellers' Tales</h1>
<h2>Above Bounds Theatre Collective</h2><br />
<p>Traveller's Tales follows the adventures of two budding explorers, Sally and John, as they go on a quest that takes them across land and sea.</p>
<p>The two actors on stage bring incredible energy to the performance, making it an enjoyable watch for all the family. Interaction with the audience upped the fun, as we stamped our feet to try and scare away a snake, which clearly engaged the children.</p>
<p>The story itself had an array of interesting characters that were brought to life by props and puppetry. Do not go to see this show expecting a slick, professional looking set as many props appeared handmade. But personally I think this added to the appeal and there was even an option at the end for the children to play with the props used, which was a very nice touch.</p>
<p>Along with this, there were some very cleverly created images. In particular, I loved the silhouetted train that was created, with puffs of smoke floating away from the funnel.</p>
<p>Adding to the enjoyment, there were songs for each ‘journey’, which were catchy, upbeat and very well performed by the cast. I especially liked the acapella aspect and vocal rhythms.</p>
<p>Overall, this performance is full of energy and fun for the whole family, with its variety of enchanting characters and stories.<br />
