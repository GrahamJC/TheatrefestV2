<h1>Yel(low)</h1>
<h2>Taw Graduate Dance Company</h2><br />
<p>
Yel(low) was an imaginative and inventive piece of theatre brought with energy and intensity to the stage by the Taw Graduate Dance Company. From the moment I entered the auditorium I felt shivers down my spine, in part due to the moody lighting and striking set, which consisted of a bare washing line and a strangely conspicuous pile of clothing which concealed a performer.  It was with her stirring that the performance commenced.</p>  
<p>The performances from this energetic and youthful trio was just what was needed to bring the piece to life. I particularly liked the use of the clothing. The way it was used throughout the performance was original and witty.</p>
<p>The piece began in silence and remained so for the majority of the performance. This worked to excellent effect as it really intensified the atmosphere. The sound of feet landing on the stage and heavy breathing really echoed in the large space to great effect.</p>
<p>The dynamic changed dramatically when music was introduced which was the backdrop for some really comic moments which were timed to perfection. This made a refreshing change from the dark and serious beginning to the piece. The fluidity of the moves can be put down to a great feel of teamwork and achievement from the performers who were clearly having a ball on stage.
