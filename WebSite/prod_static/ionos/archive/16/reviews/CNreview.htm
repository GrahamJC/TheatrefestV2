<h1>Nose Business</h1>
<h2>Clown Noir<br /></h2><br />
<p>Joe Bloodworth is a clown who
busks for a living and the
audience, his audience, gets
drawn into his tale. At first the
relationship is an uneasy one
as we watch him drinking in
his un-salubrious corner and
he, slightly aggressively, pan
handles for coins.</p><p>
Then he starts telling his tales,
unburdening himself , starting with the death of his
father, moving to good times in Gorbachev’s Russia
before the days of capitalism and the mafia forced him
to move on; to harder days in a cold , bleak Germany
and finally the long journey home to be near his
mother.</p><p>
But the real journey is the emotional one of moving
away from his family and towards something that
offers the good life, searching for a role, and back
again to making a small but real connection.</p><p>
This is a very moving, bitter-sweet hour of theatre, it is
well structured and well-paced. The tale is enhanced
by an apt sound track of original German Expressionist
music in the style of Kurt Weil, which is integral to the
action. There is something of a Becket clown here.</p><p>
There is a slight problem with the venue in that, as
there is no rake, the people at the back can’t see
anything happening at floor level. That aside, it is an
involving, well- crafted piece which, incidentally, the
thumbnail sketch in the festival brochure does not do
justice. More than one member of the audience left
with a tear in their eye.</p><p>
Highly recommended.<br />
