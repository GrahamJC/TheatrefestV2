<h1>Deadline</h1>
<h2>Pilot's Thumb</h2><br />
<p>An incredibly engaging
whodunit; Deadline
offers a unique spin on
the tried and tested
murder mystery
formula.</p><p>
The plot begins during
the interrogation of elderly local oddball Paul
concerning a missing person’s case. His relationship
with young nurse Louise is closely examined as the
blame is pinned on him. We frequently revisit their
late walk home and as his recollections begin to raise
questions we are left to speculate over the identity of
the true culprit.</p><p>
The structure drew me in as I eagerly awaited the next
clue. Set on a simplistic yet effective stage the focus
was placed on the characters. Their captivating
streams of consciousness were as perfectly paced as
they were performed. The subtle backstories were
intriguing and offered new contexts and fresh
perspectives when piecing together the crime. Danny
Strike and Cassie Williamson shone in their roles as
two opposites searching for safety and comfort whilst
Beth Hewlett’s sharp flashes as a camera busy
journalist emphasised the effects of an intrusive press
and their flippant statements.</p><p>
The strong narrative and clever direction kept the
piece from ever stalling as you began to question the
crime itself. This thought provoking drama will leave
you scratching your heads in search of an answer
that’s been laid out before you.</p><p>
A great achievement.<br />
