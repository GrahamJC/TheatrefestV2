<h1>Just Charming</h1>
<h2>James Luckraft-Law</h2><br />
<p>“Once upon a time there
was a man who lived at
home with his parents and
worked in a shop.”</p><p>
We are all aware of the
great heroic acts that come
along-side the title of being
a prince. More often than
not it requires saving an entire kingdom –
including damsels in distress. But what if this is no
longer a requirement?</p><p>
This performances’ focus is not so much on the
inherent greatness that comes with being royalty,
but the trials and tribulations that come with
being human.</p><p>
This witty one-man show delves into the relatable
struggles faced when you are an average human
being in search of your fairy tale ending - when
crowns and swords are not so much your forte as
vodka and terrible dates. Lacking in both selfconfidence
and the financial ability to own his
own horse, we follow this individuals’ journey of
thoughts as he questions his role within his
personal kingdom.</p><p>
It’s safe to say that we may not be about to hang
out the bunting for this modern day prince (in
many aspects of his life) but his comical reflection
on his experiences, as well as predictions for his
future, has us all rooting for his happy ever after.<br />
